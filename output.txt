clench my fists and beat it I light my torch and burn it I am the beast I worship And I know soon come my time For in mine void a pale horse burns But I fear not the time Im taken Past the point of no return Wage war like no tomorrow Cuz no hell there wont be one For all who deny the struggle The triumphant overcomeme Trips to where few have been Out of thin air upon high winds Rites begin when the sun descends Have felt what few will ever know Have seen the truth beneath the glow Of the ebb and flow where roots of all mysteries grow I am below so far below The bottom line Transmitting live transmissions rise From the depths out of controlled by Suspended glance of an unblinking eyes Imminent gaze cast pon the path that winds Pon the path I find and claim as mine To ride the waves of unrest Made to make me shine as a testament To why the ways of the blind will never get Shit but shanked by my disrespect Dismiss this life worship death Cold blood night of serpents breath Exhaled like spells from the endlessness In the bottomless wells of emptiness Channeled to invoke what we represent Secret order Elitist horde of Creeping fire Seizing power Riders of the lupus hour Sacrifice to rise beyond Deep inside the violent calm To glorify and for life adorn With all that dies to become unborn I close my eyes and seize it I clench my fists and beat it I light my torch and burn it I am the beast I worship I am the beast I worship In the time before time eyes bove which horns Curve like psychotropic scythes And smell of torn flesh bled dry By hell swarms of pestis flies Vomiting forth flames lit by An older than ancient force That slays this life with no remorse Feel my vessel go up in flames Flesh torch lit by thee unnamed Direct connection to the source Vestment of unnatural force Forever burning black torch Wisdom of the old and true Possessed by the chosen few Shining to reveal the ways Of a darkness that pervades All that is and ever was Inferno of witches blood Worship is not on bended knee Nature knows not of mercy To pray is to accept defeat Power pisses on the weak Bow and beheaded by the beast Beggar on a bitches leash Scum is desperate for relief Worship is the way I ride Witching currents through the eye Of storms that force the false to die Worship the flames with which I rise Into apocalyptic skies Harsh winds flay mine flesh to bone In splintered skeleton I roam Wastelands with not to call my own But the path I walk alone The hunger burns within my gut As my bones turn into dust And I know soon come my time For in mine void a pale horse burns But I fear not the time Im taken Past the point of no return Wage war like no tomorrow know well there wont we one For all who deny the struggle The triumphant overcome  I close my eyes and seize it I clench my fists and beat it I light my torch and burn it I am the beast I worship I am the beast I worship﻿get get get get got got got got blood rush to my head lit hot lock poppin off

watching me watch them watch me Hole in this platinum ship of fools nomadic rule concept no rules Mobile shrine of this destitute wasteland mute Screaming at me winking at me like I love it Fucking wit me fuck it My star gate in a vacuum monitors eye view This valley is an urn this valley Im wading through Feel like Im chasing after me feel like dead weight in a sea of vaseline All that cant be

close my eyes and seize it I clench my fists and beat it I light my torch and burn it I am the beast I worship And I know soon come my time For in mine void a pale horse burns But I fear not the time Im taken Past the point of no return Wage war like no tomorrow Cuz no hell there wont be one For all who deny the struggle The triumphant overcomeme Trips to where few have been Out of thin air upon high winds Rites begin when the sun descends Have felt what few will ever know Have seen the truth beneath the glow Of the ebb and flow where roots of all mysteries grow I am below so far below The bottom line Transmitting live transmissions rise From the depths out of controlled by Suspended glance of an unblinking eyes Imminent gaze cast pon the path that winds Pon the path I find and claim as mine To ride the waves of unrest Made to make me shine as a testament To why the ways of the blind will never get Shit but shanked by my disrespect Dismiss this life worship death Cold blood night of serpents breath Exhaled like spells from the endlessness In the bottomless wells of emptiness Channeled to invoke what we represent Secret order Elitist horde of Creeping fire Seizing power Riders of the lupus hour Sacrifice to rise beyond Deep inside the violent calm To glorify and for life adorn With all that dies to become unborn I close my eyes and seize it I clench my fists and beat it I light my torch and burn it I am the beast I worship I am the beast I worship In the time before time eyes bove which horns Curve like psychotropic scythes And smell of torn flesh bled dry By hell swarms of pestis flies Vomiting forth flames lit by An older than ancient force That slays this life with no remorse Feel my vessel go up in flames Flesh torch lit by thee unnamed Direct connection to the source Vestment of unnatural force Forever burning black torch Wisdom of the old and true Possessed by the chosen few Shining to reveal the ways Of a darkness that pervades All that is and ever was Inferno of witches blood Worship is not on bended knee Nature knows not of mercy To pray is to accept defeat Power pisses on the weak Bow and beheaded by the beast Beggar on a bitches leash Scum is desperate for relief Worship is the way I ride Witching currents through the eye Of storms that force the false to die Worship the flames with which I rise Into apocalyptic skies Harsh winds flay mine flesh to bone In splintered skeleton I roam Wastelands with not to call my own But the path I walk alone The hunger burns within my gut As my bones turn into dust And I know soon come my time For in mine void a pale horse burns But I fear not the time Im taken Past the point of no return Wage war like no tomorrow know well there wont we one For all who deny the struggle The triumphant overcome  I close my eyes and seize it I clench my fists and beat it I light my torch and burn it I am the beast I worship I am the beast I worshipIt goes it goes it goes it goes It goes it goes it goes it

through your chest you die Im barely there Im everywhere Heavy thin air sahara mascara smeared end of an era Tracks on Heras peacock thighs china white skies ivory of my leper eyes Tone of sighs off nylon lips In fish net wet guise of gimp horizon slit bled like my wrist I suck it dry Which nipples mine read the signs still cant decide At your own risk at your own risk Dont touch me bitch dont touch me bitch Accustomed to these satin glitches drippin from my caskets inners Charmer play me out the basket last image I saw was splintered My reflection wasnt in it in slow motion I give in Where you runnin now where you runnin now Hopeless premonitions Tomorrow didnt come some say its hiding but theyre the ones whove hidden Euphoria followed by visions of peasants eating pigeons Where you runnin now where you runnin now There was a artificial death in the west east All pyramids on deck shine Wet hair on her neck breathe G o d she shoot pussy through your chest you die Watching me watching me watch them watch me Hole in this platinum ship of fools nomadic rule concept no rules Mobile shrine of this destitute wasteland mute Screaming at me winking at me like I love it Fucking wit me fuck it My star gate in a vacuum monitors eye view This valley is an urn this valley Im wading through Feel like Im chasing after me feel like dead weight in a sea of vaseline All that cant be seen watching me watching me watch them watch me Try not to dwell on my cell my empty shell shedding me Artificial death in the west east Pyramids on deck shine No matter where I turn shut down shut down Everyones a runaway where you runnin now There was a artificial death in the west east All pyramids on deck shine Wet hair on her neck breathe G o d she shoot pussy through your chest you die Watching me watching me watch them watch me There was a artificial death in the west east All pyramids on deck shine Wet hair on her neck breathe G o d she shoot pussy through your chest you dieI close my eyes and seize it I clench my fists and beat it I light my torch and burn it I am the beast I worship And I know soon come my time For in mine void a pale horse burns But I fear not the time Im taken Past the point of no return Wage war like no tomorrow Cuz no hell there wont be one For all who deny the struggle The triumphant overcomeme Trips to where few have been Out of thin air upon high winds Rites begin when the sun descends Have felt what few will ever know Have seen the truth beneath the glow Of the ebb and flow where roots of all mysteries grow I am below so far below The bottom line Transmitting live transmissions rise From the depths out of controlled by Suspended glance of an unblinking eyes Imminent gaze cast pon the path that winds Pon the path I find and claim as mine To ride the waves of unrest Made to make me shine as a testament To why the ways of the blind will never get Shit but shanked by my disrespect Dismiss this life worship death Cold blood night of serpents breath Exhaled like spells from the endlessness In the bottomless wells of emptiness Channeled to invoke what we represent Secret order Elitist horde of Creeping fire Seizing power Riders of the lupus hour Sacrifice to rise beyond Deep inside the violent calm To glorify and for life adorn With all that dies to become unborn I close my eyes and seize it I clench my fists and beat it I light my torch and burn it I am the beast I worship I am the beast I worship In the time before time eyes bove which horns Curve like psychotropic scythes And smell of torn flesh bled dry By hell swarms of pestis flies Vomiting forth flames lit by An older than ancient force That slays this life with no remorse Feel my vessel go up in flames Flesh torch lit by thee unnamed Direct connection to the source Vestment of unnatural force Forever burning black torch Wisdom of the old and true Possessed by the chosen few Shining to reveal the ways Of a darkness that pervades All that is and ever was Inferno of witches blood Worship is not on bended knee Nature knows not of mercy To pray is to accept defeat Power pisses on the weak Bow and beheaded by the beast Beggar on a bitches leash Scum is desperate for relief Worship is the way I ride Witching currents through the eye Of storms that force the false to die Worship the flames with which I rise Into apocalyptic skies Harsh winds flay mine flesh to bone In splintered skeleton I roam Wastelands with not to call my own But the path I walk alone The hunger burns within my gut As my bones turn into dust And I know soon come my time For in mine void a pale horse burns But I fear not the time Im taken Past the point of no return Wage war like no tomorrow know well there wont we one For all who deny the struggle The triumphant overcome  I close my eyes and seize it I clench my fists and beat it I light my torch and burn it I am the beast I worship I am the beast I worshipIt goes it goes it goes it goes It goes it goes it goes it goes Guillotine   yah  Sit in the dark and ponder how Im fit to make the bottom fall through the floor And they all fall down   yah  It goes it goes it goes it goes Guillotine   yah  Out of the shadows barrage of witch tongue Cobra spit over apocalyptic cult killer cauldron smoke Stomp music seriously   yah  It goes it goes it goes it goes Guillotine   yah  Cant stop the groove lics jaws clear off them locks relentless raw movement Fit to knock you from here to that g spot body rock connected  To everything you want ever did want We got it why not come get it stick your head in that hole And watch me drop this cold guillotine death sentence   yah  It goes it goes it goes it goes Guillotine   yah  Hidden art between and beneath every fragmented figure of speech Tongue in reverse whenever the beat causes my jaws to call Out out out out   yah  The screens flashing red cant see shit but heads Spinning exorcist like planets Out of orbit off the edge Off mine axis whipping through doors to far more than all that’s ever been said   yah  Tie the chord kick the chair and your dead   yah  Yah  guillotine   yah  guillotine   yah  Head of a trick in a bucket Body of a trick in a bag And thrown in the fire like fuck it Gotta burn it before it goes bad One too many times been disgusted By the stench of rot is such a drag   yah  Get broke by the street like blood stained glass   yah Choke on these nuts til the very last   yah  It goes it goes it goes it goes Guillotine   yah  Serial number killing machine The illest of means To an end built on the filthy sound youre experiencing   yah  It goes it goes it goes it goes Guillotine   yah  Tinted windows bulletproof The slip knot fixin rope to noose To the grave stone grinder of cold steel  The passion that blinds me so I feel   YAH  Cant let go no it flows through our veins Blows through our tunnels and rattles our chains And they all fall down   yahI fuck the music I make it cum I fuck the music with my serpent tongue  Wanna beer have no fear comes and goes man its here No one knows feels so weird when it blows through my bones I got a jones for it I wanna know more cuz its bout what I got to show for it  I want some more of it I want too much I got so bored with it I shot it up Wanna light my torch with it and get all fucked up  What is it where is it How will it affect me Fuck that shit I need that shits bound to be the death of me Fuck buying it Im taking it and sharing it with nobody  Cuz all I really need is some cool shit to mob Like driving down the street to the beat of a blow job  I own that shit On some throw back shit You already know that shit You even know bout how I know the man Who grows that bitch …  You cant buy it with your money You cant find it overseas Its one of those things that seems outlandish Til you have its not a dream As for me Im cool with it And thats alright cuz its my thing  Work that angle til its beveled Curve of the blade doubled Edge made to bleed the struggle Best believe the games a hustle Observer of the strange occurrences Conjurer of the subtle Unseen but felt disturbances That burst a bitches bubble  That’s right its all mine It’s all mine never was yours Like how you wait in line While I walk straight through the door straight through the Hear you say something But aint nothing – spectators ignored Pay no mind to that chumps Just a player hatin whore  I fuck the music I make it cum I fuck the music with my serpent tongue  Ain’t no fun if the aliens cant have none  How I fuck it dirty How I make it twitch and scream How it screams oh baby hurt me Work me to the bone oh please How I bend the rhythm over And hit hit hit it on my knees Give give give it up I need it all the time Bleed it on the drop of a dime – down to pound it til it shines Moonlit lake of blood red wine Make no mistake I makes it mine  Break shit down and make it grind To the groove used to align The cascading shades of jaded blues with these rhymes Nuclear steeze creeps and winds Through secrets behind and between Every time I scream  Shit is mine Its all mine All the time Shit is mine  What is it where is it how will it affect me Fuck that shit I need that shit  Thought you knew thought you thought Thought you did but did not Come on through what you got Is it cool is it hot?  Check one two man dont stop Im not through black blood clot In my view like that twat Spread eagle cross the block  Need no ego to rock What we know just gets dropped How we keep shit on lock  Cuz all I really need is some cool shit to mod Like driving down the street to the beat of a blow job  Shit is mine Its all mine All the time Shit is mineInto the flame into the fire With no regard for a thing fuck that Im the lord of the game I rule this empire Lord of the game Born to reign above all that you claim to know beyond a doubt Cuz no one has came even close to the train Of thought we drop like neutron bombs from the tower  Control this and bang this then watch it rise higher Than anything seen in your entire Life spent in chains sonic live wire Electrified rain from the lips of the driver Whippin the wheel Flippin donuts to peel Out on the face of the base wheres my lighter? Need it to kill one more and chill while I feel It so much my gut burns like the tires Movin this movement of real shit inspired By all that has come before this and was done For the real ones packin real guns loaded with power Shower the slums with power from the war marching drums that have come to devour The weakness that runs when we come Fuckin cowards  When they tell you you must make it And you think hell no Got a bad feeling and cant shake it Hits so low  Lord of the game Born to reign above all that you claim to know beyond a doubt Cuz no one has came even close to the train of thought We drop like neutron bombs from the tower Pon which we maintain Like soldiers of fame And fortune denied as to to get by without the Bullshit coming at me from all sides Nowhere to run nowhere to hide Told me it was all good but they lied Dont wait to see whites of their eyes Death to everyone who does not recognize Wars never done think it is you die  Where was I now Like I said before Hear someone knockin At my front door Who could it be should I ignore The knockin or see what could be in store For me if I leave the safety of the shore So many options so little time To do what I want fore the end of the line Places its blade in the small of my spine Is it paranoia is it real? How long can a man enjoy what he doesnt feel  When they ask if you can make it And you dont wanna go  When they tell you you must make it And you think hell no Got a bad feeling and cant shake it Hits so low  Rather be stuck naked Than waste my time like the last time And every time before that Dont waste my time even one more time When you know that shit is whack Dont make me remind of you of the last time you Said youd never go back  Fuck where youre from Fuck where youre goin Its all about where youre atTriple six five forked tongue Subatomic penetration rapid fire through your skull How I shot it on one taking it back to the days of trying to lose controlSwerving in a blaze of fire raging through my bones  Oh shit Im feeling it   Takyon Hell yeah fuck yeah I feel like killing it   Takyon Alright thats tight what its like to experience   Takyon  Out of the blue in through the back Door coming through like fuck what was that Man I dont know but it made me feel so heated  How we creep without showing you jack Shit from below give a shit if you know Cause even if you did youd keep coming back Back for more need it man youre addicted to the heat  We make beats catch Beat it til it bleeds to death each track Epileptic seize every head we crack Like EPMD snapping necks as we tap energy from everything on and off the map  Oh shit Im feeling it   Takyon Hell yeah fuck yeah I feel like killing it   Takyon Alright thats tight what its like to experience   Takyon Takyon shot down your throat like a keg of bee Choke on the smoke we in and exhale til the whole chamber is clear  Haters act so fucking weird Try to stain this atmosphere But they cant cause its way too sheer How to make a hater disappear Take shit where it aint never been Fuck what you thought could not comprehend  This shit if I fisted your brain with it 10 9 8 7 triple six five forked tongue Criminal level crunk lightning storm Get out the way or get up torn Aint a picture big enough to fit What we dig up from the core Of all that they forgot ever was Militant march of this war  Takyon   taking them down All we see is blood Takyon   turning them out How to trick out and freak that buzz  Oh shit Im feeling it   Takyon Hell yeah fuck yeah I feel like killing it   Takyon Alright thats tight what its like to experience   Takyon  Lunar eclipse forcing you to trip Off the moonlit fire we spray Cryonic haunted bullets hollow tipped with toxic waste So heres the deal if you dont feel ill Dont want it nowhere near my zone That shit is dead cant nobody get With that shit gets dial toned Takyon   bitch slapping pussy clots and clones Takyon   setting off unibombs inside your dome  Give it up bitch you know this is it Get with this or get left cause its on!
